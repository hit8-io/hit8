# Docker with OrbStack

This project uses **OrbStack** as the Docker runtime instead of Docker Desktop. OrbStack is a faster, more efficient Docker alternative for macOS.

## Guidelines

- **Use OrbStack for all Docker operations** - The project is configured to work with OrbStack
- OrbStack provides a drop-in replacement for Docker Desktop with better performance
- All `docker` and `docker-compose` commands work the same way with OrbStack
- OrbStack automatically starts when Docker commands are executed

## Docker Commands

All standard Docker commands work with OrbStack:

```bash
# Start services with docker-compose
docker-compose up api web

# Start services with Doppler (secrets management)
doppler run -- docker-compose up api web

# Check running containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

## Starting Services

To start the frontend and backend services:

```bash
# With Doppler (recommended for production secrets)
doppler run -- docker-compose up api web --build

# Without Doppler (for local development with default values)
docker-compose up api web --build
```

## Notes

- OrbStack must be installed and running on your system
- If you see "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon" errors, ensure OrbStack is running
- OrbStack provides the same Docker socket at `/var/run/docker.sock` as Docker Desktop
- No special configuration is needed - OrbStack is compatible with standard Docker tooling
- Use `orbctl status` to check if OrbStack is running
- Use `orbctl restart --all` to restart all OrbStack machines if needed
