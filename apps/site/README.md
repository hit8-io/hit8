# Marketing Site

The marketing site for hit8.io, built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Content

Content is managed directly in TypeScript files located in `src/content/`. Edit content by modifying the TypeScript files directly.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

This runs TypeScript compilation and Vite build. Content is bundled directly from TypeScript files - no build-time generation needed.
